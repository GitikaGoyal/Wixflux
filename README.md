## 📁 Completed Projects

### 🔢 1. [Stock Price Prediction using LSTM](./01_Stock_Price_Prediction)
- Predicts future stock prices using an LSTM (Long Short-Term Memory) model.
- Dataset: Apple (AAPL) stock data via Yahoo Finance
- Tools: TensorFlow, Keras, yFinance, Scikit-Learn
- Output: 30-day future forecast visualized on a line plot

### 🧪 2. [Breast Cancer Prediction using SVM (with Streamlit GUI)](./02_Breast_Cancer_Prediction)
- Predicts whether a tumor is benign or malignant using Support Vector Machine (SVM).
- Dataset: Breast Cancer Wisconsin Dataset (from sklearn.datasets)
- Tools: Scikit-learn, Streamlit, Pandas, Matplotlib
- Output: A lightweight web interface (Streamlit) for real-time predictions from user input features
